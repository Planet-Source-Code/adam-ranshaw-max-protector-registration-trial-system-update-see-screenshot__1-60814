This as took ages to make and i am only 15 so please vote and PLEASE leave comments on what you think, thank you - also if anyone can make it so it encrypts the registry enterys it makes and then decrypts them to read them please let me know.

(WARNING - PLEASE ENSURE YOU ARE LOGGED ON AS AN ADMINISTRATOR BEFORE USING THIS SOFTWARE)
